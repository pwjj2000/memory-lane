## Proposed Level of Achievement

Project Gemini

## Motivation

In this day and age, technology and social media have taken over the driver’s seat when it comes to entertainment. The local childhood games that brought us countless hours of amusement in the past are slowly becoming a distant memory. Furthermore, in the Covid-19 pandemic where face-to-face interaction is limited, it is much harder to compete in “hand games” like we used to.

But what if there is a way to instead use technology to keep the tradition of our childhood games going? What if players could come together online and reminisce about old times? 


## Aim

We hope to develop a platform for users to virtually compete in popular (local) childhood “hand games” - Zha, Chopsticks, and Thumbs.
